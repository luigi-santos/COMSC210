Pseudocode for basketball league
// Include necessary headers for file handling, data structures, etc.

// Define a function to simulate environmental changes over time
    // Parameters: map of team stats, number of games

// Define main function
    // Initialize a map to store team information, each associated with an array of lists for points, assists, and rebounds

    // Open an external file to read initial team data and populate the map
        // If file does not open, print an error and exit

    // Read data from file and populate map
        // For each line, extract team name and starting stats
        // Insert stats into the appropriate list in the array for each team

    // Close the file

    // Begin a time-based simulation for game stats
        // For 25 games
            // Iterate through each team in the map
                // For each team, simulate game stats
                    // Randomly generate points, assists, and rebounds for the game
                        // Add generated sts to each respective list in the array
                        // If removing, select a random species from the list to remove
                    // Print the changes for this game, e.g., "Warriors scored {points} points, made {assists} assists, and grabbed {rebounds} rebounds."

            // Simulate random game variations
            // random games can boosts or reduce points, assists, or rebounds
            // Print notable changes, such as "{team} had a performance boost in Game {game_number}"

            // Wait or pause briefly to simulate the passage of time between games
// End of main function
